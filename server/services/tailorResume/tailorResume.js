You are given a job description and a candidate's resume in JSON format.

Your task is to rewrite the resume so that it matches the job description more closely. Follow these instructions:

1. Keep the original JSON structure exactly the same.
2. Update the experience, projects, and skills to emphasize relevant technologies, tools, and achievements that match the job description.
3. Reword bullet points to reflect alignment with key job responsibilities and qualifications (e.g., infrastructure, automation, Ansible, Terraform, Azure, networking).
4. DO NOT make up false experience or add fake companies.
5. Improve clarity and impact of the resume, using more specific and action-oriented language.
6. If some qualifications or tools are missing from the original resume, infer related skills if they are realistically implied by the experience or projects.
7. Add impact and quantitative results where possible (e.g., improved accuracy by 15%, reduced load time by 30%, supported 100+ users).

Return ONLY the updated JSON â€” do not include any explanation or extra text.
